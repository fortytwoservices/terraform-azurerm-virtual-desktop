| Due to the renaming of Company, the Github organization has changed name from "amestofortytwo" to "fortytwoservices". Pre-existing Terraform code would need to change that in code. |

| This module does not currently deploy Azure Files Share and Files Directory for FSLogix due to a bug in the AzureRM Terraform Provider. This step has to be completed manually in scenarios where FSLogix is needed. |
